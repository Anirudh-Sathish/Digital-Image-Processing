### Assignment 8 

Create a concentric square image, with inner square pixel intensity values as 125 and outer square as 0 everywhere. Find the projection along the row, column, diagonal with 45 degree and 135 degree. Reconstruct the image by applying back projection algorithm using the following ways:
1. the row projection only
2. the row and column projections
3. the row and column and diagonal 45-degree projections
4. the row and column and diagonal 45- and 135-degree projections
