# Assignment 2 

##### _Anirudh Sathish_

### Task 2 
Let f be an image (Lena). 0 ≤ x ≤ 255 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 255.
Generate
fi
(x, y) = f(x, y) + ηi(x, y) where ηi(x, y) is the Gaussian noise with mean = 0 and variance= 1

Find 1/n(∑ fi(x, y)
, say it as g.
1. Display f, g and f1, f2, ...... fn.
2. Do it for n=5, n=10, n=20 and n=30


### Running instructions 
- Install skimage.util 
- Use the random_noise from the above package to generate the noise 
- Follow the rest of the steps from the task 

### Observations 
- With increase in value of n , the average image looks better and less noisier
